            <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lisa made her solo debut with her single album Lalisa in September 2021. The album sold over 736,000 copies in its release week in South Korea, making her the first female artist to do so. The music video for its lead single of the same name recorded 73.6 million views on YouTube in first 24 hours of its release, becoming the most-viewed music video in the first 24 hours on the platform by a solo artist. Both "Lalisa" and the album's second single "Money" were top-ten hits on the Billboard Global 200.
            Lisa has earned several accolades, including five Guinness World Records, a Mnet Asian Music Award, a Gaon Chart Music Award, and the first MTV Video Music Award and MTV Europe Music Award ever won by a K-pop soloist. She is one of the most influential K-pop idols globally, and has been the most-followed K-pop idol on Instagram since 2019.</h3>
